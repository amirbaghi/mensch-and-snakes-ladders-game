# mensch-game
Main structure and logic for Mensch (no render implementation), written in C++. A project done to implement and use some game development design patterns in action. 

Also includes a "profiling execution mode" where the game is run 120 times, and some game dynamic metrics are measured and written to a text file and plotted out (in cumulative and interval manners). 

The game dynamic metrics measured for each player are: Wait Duration, Gained Score, Lost Score, Number of Starts, Covered Distance.
